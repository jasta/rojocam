x264 was compiled from:

git://git.videolan.org/x264.git
commit 0c7dab9c2a106ce3ee5d6ad7282afb49e1cc3954

ffmpeg was compiled from:

git://git.videolan.org/ffmpeg.git
commit 901af94b6976c05d7c092024c1dcf891ab3be66a

They were built using android-ndk-r7 with the scripts build-x264.sh and
build-ffmpeg.sh respectively.  build-ffmpeg.sh hardcodes the path to x264
though and must be updated.  Much appreciation to anyone who automates this
build process better...
